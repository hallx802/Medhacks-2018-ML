Mental Moments is a journaling app aimed towards providing mental health resources to individuals who normally do not have them (whether it be because of financial burdens, cultural or societal stigma, professional bias, or a number of other barriers) as well as providing mental health data about underrepresented demographics to the greater medical community. To achieve this, we have designed a word-frequency-analysis program to analyse a user's input in a virtual joural and use the data to provide visuals for the user to immediately see whether they may be at risk for abnormal feelings of depression, anger, anxiety, or suicidal ideation; it is planned to also suggest to users mental health resources (or avenues to finding those resources) in response to data collected on their mental state from their written input. Machine learning is also planned to be utilized to create more robust methods of analysing user input by analyzing entries sentence by sentence, rather than just by single words. Users are encouraged to take a proven DSM-V Assessment questionnaire, and we will use the scores from questions to create weekly or biweekly progress reports for users based also on journal entry data. The users can thus see in real time the progress they are making, therefore empowering them to seek further resources if trends indicate a need to do so, or saving them both time and money if they see a drastic improvement by the journaling process. 

Python:
The Python word-frequency-analysis program works by taking in a string input and comparing each word in said string to words in the following four categories of negative emotions: “Anger”, “Depression”, “Anxiety”, and “Suicidal Ideation”. Words for each category were found online through taking synonyms of commonly known words associated with each emotion. The program calculates a “prediction” of what the user may be feeling as follows: if the combined (sum of) ratios of “negative” words to “normal” or non-“negative” words surpasses a threshold of 2.5%, the user is seen as experiencing abnormally negative emotions. If it is predicted that the user is experiencing a “negative” emotional state, the program will output what the most frequent of negative emotions is out of the four categories stated prior. The threshold of 2.5% was calculated by finding the average frequencies of negative words in four different negative vocabulary-containing songs: “A Team” by Ed Sheeran, “1-800-273-8255” by Logic, “Kim” by Eminem”, and “Mad World” by Gary Jules/Tears for Fears. The average combined frequency of negative vocabulary was around 4% for these very negative vocabulary-containing songs, so the threshold was put slightly lower at 2.5%. The program also gives pie charts for the users on their negative versus normal word frequencies, as well as on proportion breakdowns of the four different categories of negative words.
