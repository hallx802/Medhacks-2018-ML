Mental Moments is a journaling app aimed towards providing mental health resources to individuals who normally do not have them (whether it be because of financial burdens, cultural or societal stigma, professional bias, or a number of other barriers) as well as providing mental health data about underrepresented demographics to the greater medical community. To achieve this, we have designed a word-frequency-analysis program to analyse a user's input in a virtual joural and use the data to provide visuals for the user to immediately see whether they may be at risk for abnormal feelings of depression, anger, anxiety, or suicidal ideation; it is planned to also suggest to users mental health resources (or avenues to finding those resources) in response to data collected on their mental state from their written input. Machine learning is also planned to be utilized to create more robust methods of analysing user input by analyzing entries sentence by sentence, rather than just by single words. Users are encouraged to take a proven DSM-V Assessment questionnaire, and we will use the scores from questions to create weekly or biweekly progress reports for users based also on journal entry data. The users can thus see in real time the progress they are making, therefore empowering them to seek further resources if trends indicate a need to do so, or saving them both time and money if they see a drastic improvement by the journaling process.
